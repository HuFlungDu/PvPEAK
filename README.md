# PvPEAK

Ever wanted to hurt your fellow scouts but felt bad because it wasn't legally sanctioned?

## Features

- Separate into teams based on scout color. Race to the top. Cause Havok. Only the first team to the peak survives.
- Cut ropes so you can't be followed.
- Backpacks can only be interacted with by team members, unless dropped.
- Teams are each given a backpack at the start of the game.
- Marshmallows are distributed to each team member, and cannot be taken by other teams.
- All but one team is given a backpack at each campfire. If you are late, you get no backpack.
- Items can be safely dropped around a campfire and only your team can grab them. Anywhere else, they are free game.
- Respawn at campfire, instead of statues. Statue items are first come first serve. Scouts are also invincible at the campfire while waiting with their team for the other teams.
- Fog rises with the team in first place. Don't get left behind.



Works well, and should probably be used with, [PEAK Unlimited](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/glarmer/PEAK_Unlimited/). Certain options of PEAK unlimited (Backpacks and Marshmallow stuff) are disabled when in PvPEAK mode.


## Installation

All clients need to have the mod installed in order to work. If someone joins without the mod installed, you will get a warning. Use a mod manager to handle dependencies, there's a few of them, so it's easier just to install with that. If you absolutely need to do it manually, you already know how.

## Bugs
